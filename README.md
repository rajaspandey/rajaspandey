## Hi, I'm Rajas ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Rajas Pandey, a data scientist and researcher trying to understand our society better using data!

ðŸŒ± I'm passionate about exploring innovative solutions to complex social problems, whether it's modeling household behavior towards energy efficiency or understanding risks in new financial instruments. I trained in Economics and Computer Science at Duke and BITS Pilani, and am currently obsessed with models for determining causality in machine learning and AI.

ðŸ”­ At work, Iâ€™m currently develop quant models using new data sources to predict loan defaults, frauds and pricing in non-tradtional portfolios. 

âœ¨ My go-to tech stack for most data stuff is Python, PostgrSQL, and R. For deep learning, I use PyTorch and CUDA. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on cool data stuff. Especially obsessed with problems on climate, energy and causality. You can reach out to me on my [Email](mailto:rajaspandey9@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajas-pandey/)
